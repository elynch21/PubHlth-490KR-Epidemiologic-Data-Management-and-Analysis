- Undergraduate Course Work from Public Health 490KR Epidemiologic Data Management & Analysis, Taught by Professor Katherine W. Reeves, PhD, MPH
- Course taken Spring Semester 2018

- Students will develop fundamental skills in epidemiologic research, including data management, data analysis, and interpretation of results 
- A major emphasis of the course will be to provide students with practical experience in analyzing research datasets using both Stata and SAS

    
    
    Course Objectives: At the end of this course, students will be able to:
  	  
      
      - 1) Plan, organize, and document data management and analysis tasks to obtain reproducible results

  	   - 2) Appropriately clean and label epidemiologic datasets using Stata and SAS

  	   - 3) Calculate basic descriptive statistics using Stata and SAS

  	   - 4) Calculate relative risks and odds ratios using Stata and SAS

    - CEPH Outcome Competencies: This course educates students in the following Council for Education in Public Health (CEPH) outcome competencies:
    - Analyze data using appropriate epidemiologic and biostatistical techniques; Use computer software for data processing and statistical analyses

- Required Texts
