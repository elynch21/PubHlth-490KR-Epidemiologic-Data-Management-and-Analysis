**********************************/

*3.use a libname statement to tell SAS where your dataset is stored;

libname ph490kr "Z:\Emily's Docs\Courses\Pubhlth 490kr\Datasets";

*4.basic data step to read in the dataset;
data sess14; /*this will put the dataset into "work", if I want to save it I can write data ph490kr.sess16*/
set ph490kr.VitDSess14;
run;

*5. use proc contents to view info about the dataset;
proc contents data=sess14;
run;

*6. use proc print;
*a. print ev_smk and cur_smk;
proc print data=sess14;
var ev_smk cur_smk;
run;

*b. as above, but only first 100 observations;
proc print data=sess14 (obs=100);
var ev_smk cur_smk;
run;

*c. brand for current smokers;
proc print data=sess14;
where cur_smk=1;
var brand;
run;

*d. cig_day for those starting smoking after age 15;
proc print data=sess14;
where age_cig>15 & age_cig^=99;
var cig_day;
run;

*7. sort dataset by cur_smk;
proc sort data=sess14;
by cur_smk;
run;

*8. print cig_day by current smoking status;
*note: you need to have the data sorted before you can use "by";
proc print data=sess14;
by cur_smk;
var cig_day;
run;

*9. save a copy of the dataset including only current smokers;

*code below will create a "temporary" dataset stored in the library "work";
data cursmk;
set sess14;
where cur_smk=1;
run;

*to make a permament dataset, we just specify the name of a permanent SAS library;
data ph490kr.cursmk;
set sess14;
where cur_smk=1;
Run;
