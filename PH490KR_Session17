*Start by assigning libname to folder where dataset;

run;
proc freq data=sess17;
table yrs_oc*ever_oc/missing;
run;

*need to set 99 to "0" for those who answer "no" to ever OC use;
/*also, many said no to ever_oc but then provided a number of years of OC use--how to handle?
1. could set to "0," essentially applying skip pattern (if they had skipped the question as
they were supposed to, they would have been set to 0)
2. set to missing, since answers are inconsistent
3. keep answers and set ever_oc to yes since they are indicating having used OCs

Any of these options are ok, as long as you are consistent, document, and have a good rationale.
Let's go with option #1*/

/*have 14 who answered yes to current but no to ever; 
we will set to no to be consistent with our decision of how to handle yrs_oc above
also have values of 99 that need to be set to no
and some values of 99 when ever_oc=1 or missing that need to be set to missing*/

*let's clean up our dataset by dropping the variables we recoded;

drop cig_day age_cig age_qt yrs_oc curr_oc;

*3. save a permanent copyl;
